# Stock Value Prediction with RNNs
Extracting sequence patterns out of time series data has seen a paradigm shift since RNNs have
become more ubiquitious. Previously, adaptive filters, many forms moving average, autoregression algorithms used to dominate this field. 
Although, RNNs are computationally more complex compared to its predessors, the performance gain makes these architectures worthwhile. Especially when the training and prediction can be decoupled as train offline, predict real-time.
